# COMP-4334
Parallel and Distributed Computing for Data Science

### Course Overview
This course will cover widely used parallel and distributed computing methods, focusing on
datacenter-scale distributed software and methods such as Spark, MapReduce, distributed
machine learning, and graph algorithms. We will study the types of algorithms that work well
with these techniques and have the opportunity to implement some of these algorithms. We will
also look at the types of hardware architectures that have been developed along with these
computing methods.

### Objectives
Students will be able to program in a distributed Spark environment. Students will be able to
understand functional programming and the MapReduce framework. Students will be able to
explain the fundamental hardware issues that led to current datacenter programming models.
Students will have a general knowledge of issues in parallel programming and data movement
within such systems. Students will gain knowledge of distributed machine learning and graph
processing systems.
